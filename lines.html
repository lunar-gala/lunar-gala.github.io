                    <p>Spaces Corners, Pennsylvania is like much of rural America; it is an assemblage of residences, abandoned buildings, acres of farmland and local mysteries. The collection derives from utilitarian aesthetics, with an emphasis on pockets and knit pieces created from Jodi Horgan’s flock of sheep. Spaces Corners draws from the principals of rural life by including locally sourced materials, connecting to utilitarian design elements, and ultimately, the collection approaches a retrospective on an American lifestyle.</p>

Extracting colors from natural ingredients, soaked and washed in water, and dried with wind, the textile contain the essence of the universe, and most importantly a story. Ultimately, Quinta Essentia is a reminder to go back to the fundamentals of fashion, to recognize our ancestor’s wisdom, and to celebrate it without polluting our habitat.s</p>

The lettering “ABCD” that appears throughout the line is a term meaning “American Born Confused Desi”: a term that many older generation Indians use.

The approach to the design takes subtle notions and incorporates them as notable forms that will compliment the human body.

                    <p>Richard Saenz fall/winter 2020 collection is about upcycling/recycling unwanted garments. Mainly using post-consumer waste. Taking garments out of the waste cycle. Experimentation and introducing innovative ideas that look beyond the societal norms of what is considered acceptable. Exploring new possibilities. Unexpected cuts, oversized and distorted shapes which offer a different perspective to what the wearer is presenting. Creating designs in a fast, ever-changing society requires experimentalism and the courage to try fresh and ambitious things. Looking and moving forward while respecting the past. The process involves finding creative ways to reuse textiles, usually resulting in one-of-a-kind items. A cause we can all become part of to secure the future of upcoming generations.</p>

Am I ready to face the world? Lifeline is a piece of yarn inserted into a previous row to hold stitches in case of a mistake. Lifeline is a security blanket for the soon-to-be adults, venturing out into the world fully prepared to make mistakes.</p>

                    <p>Eurowestern visualizes the contrasted upbringing between Dutch and Texan. Through these differing identities, this unisex line uses recycled materials and focuses on the repetition of one look. The iteration in form aims to focus attention on the macro and micro decisions. vulnerable while certain, liberal and reserved, extrinsic and grounded, this line creates space for an expression of self.</p>

                    <p>REPARTUS, stands for rebirth, refers to a self-metamorphosis. Homages to the surrealism movie Black Swan, the line extracts its corrupting swan image and dark aesthetics through the length of fashion. As the movie character kept breaking her moral code to create a morbid connection with “black swan” and eventually drown into darkness, the form of the line varies from mild silhouettes to dramatic and untamed ones.</p>

                    <h3 class="vert">Ashley Burbano</h3>
                    <p>I like certainty; I like feeling in control of every aspect of my life. I try to micromanage everything because I am scared of failing. But trying to control things that are out of your reach is frankly exhausting. Through this line, I imagine life without this need for control. I want to explore the possibility of briefly losing agency and just letting go — and see how that alters my art and my life.</p>

                    <p>Body dysmorphia abstracts reality and takes the physical realm into an obsessiveness that veils the judgement of the victim. Compulsivity and false imagery cover the true form of the body. Our line seeks to explore this space through masking figures with shape and material in vibrant colors, transformative sheens, and form-making. Reconstructing the imagery of women’s bodies and how we create wardrobes to abstract and limit these shapes creates a narrative of freedom through alteration.</p>

                    <h3 class="vert">Michael Powell and Selena Zhen</h3>
                    <p>This collection looks towards the application of ornamental textile trimmings through a contemporary re-interpretation of outerwear. Originally, fringe was used as a detail to prevent the unraveling of fabrics when hemming was not. In this case, the fringe application becomes more experimental, and more invasive as it begins to consume the jacket. The collection demonstrates the boisterous opportunities apparent in re-imagining the application of traditional finishing techniques.</p>

                    <p>Water is everywhere. That’s the world we live in. We inherited the mistakes from our ancestors, and nature has turned its back on us. As all the ice vanished and the sea level risen, all of our glorious past has been engulfed by the sea. A new mode of living was found. To survive, one must master the navigation of the water’s surface. Here we present effervescent, examples of everyday wear in our water-centric lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>zoöid is an exploration of light and color as a means for communication in a starless world. Inspired by deep-sea creatures that use light to communicate and coordinate, the looks in the line create an intricate lightshow on stage. Synchronizing with each other, the looks react to audio to change color on stage, creating a visual dialogue between them. This project was funded with support by Carnegie Mellon’s Undergraduate Research Office, and the Frank-Ratchye Studio for Creative Inquiry.</p>
